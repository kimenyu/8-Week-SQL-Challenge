<h1> <b>Each of the following case study questions can be answered using a single SQL statement: </b> </h1>

<ol>
<li>What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?</li>
<li>How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?</li>
<li>What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?</li>
<li>What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?</li>
<li>Which item was the most popular for each customer?</li>
<li>Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?</li>
<li>Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?</li>
<li>What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?</li>
<li>If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?</li>
<li>In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?</li>
</ol>
<h2> <b> Bonus Questions </b> </h2>
<h3> <b>Join all things </b> </h3>
The following questions are related creating basic data tables that Danny and his team can use to quickly derive insights without needing to join the underlying tables using SQL.

<h4> <b> Rank all things </b> </h4>
Danny also requires further information about the ranking of customer products, but he purposely does not need the ranking for non-member purchases so he expects null ranking values for the records when customers are not yet part of the loyalty program.
